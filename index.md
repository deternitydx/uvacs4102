# CS4102 Algorithms - Spring 2020

**Course Description:** Introduces the analysis of algorithms and the
effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such
as sorting, searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking,
divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include
heaps and search, splay, and spanning trees. Analysis techniques include
asymptotic worst-case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions
between problems

**Availability:** It is important to me to be available to our students,
and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with me during our
office hours, e-mail me and we will find the time to meet. That being
said, like everybody else I am quite busy, so it may take a day or more
to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the
course---what is working, what is not working, what can be done better,
etc.---I am very interested in hearing about them. There is an anonymous
feedback tool through Collab, or you can send me or one of the TAs an
e-mail. We tend to get bogged down by e-mail as the semester progresses,
so seeing us in person (right after lecture, during office hours, etc.)
is often a good way to get a more immediate response.
