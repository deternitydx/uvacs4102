# CS4102 Algorithms - Spring 2020

**Course Description:** Introduces the analysis of algorithms and the
effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such
as sorting, searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking,
divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include
heaps and search, splay, and spanning trees. Analysis techniques include
asymptotic worst-case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions
between problems

**Availability (new):** It is important to us to be available to our students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot connect with either of us during our office hours, e-mail us and we will find the time to meet virtually. That being said, like everybody else we are quite busy, so it may take a day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the course---what is working, what is not working, what can be done better, etc.---we are very interested in hearing about them.  Please send Prof. Hott, Prof. Horton, or one of the TAs an e-mail or post privately on Piazza to the instructors.

## Course Organization

[Schedule](schedule.html) - [Useful Topics Resources](resources.html) - [Useful Collaboration Resources](transition.html)


### Lecture Material
We will be posting new lecture material on Panopto as lecture “bundles.”  These may take the form of a few small videos on topics or up to one “normal” 75-minute lecture video, depending on the topic we are covering.  The videos will be linked from the [Schedule](schedule.html), but you will need to be logged in through Collab to access them.  We will also post any slide material there as well.  For each lecture bundle, we will provide a suggested watch-by date, on which we will base the homework schedule.

### Homework
We are planning to continue our release schedule on homeworks; they will be released and due on Collab as they have been all semester.  Please also note the new Collaboration Policy for HW5.  This is specific to the coding assignment, but we would like to extend that to written assignments as well.  We want to encourage virtual collaboration, even as we are social distancing.  Please engage in the Piazza discussion on our collaboration policy before HW6 is released next week.

### Homework Help - Piazza
We will continue to rely on Collab for organization and on Piazza for immediate help.  As we have done throughout the semester, let’s all continue to help each other on Piazza.  If you’re stuck, please post a question.  If you are waiting, you likely know the answer to someone else’s question; please help them out.  Both TAs and instructors will be more active on Piazza for the rest of the semester as well.

### TA Office Hours
Office hours will see the largest change in our course.  We very much wanted to maintain the feel of office hours.  Our TAs have been working diligently to help us transition, along with input from other course instructors and TAs.  Right now, our plan is to use Discord so that TAs can manage both a virtual queue and help groups of students at the same time.  It will require some coordination and a new system, but it appears to be a really great set-up.  We’ll be sending a second “getting started guide” soon.  We may have reduced hours for office hours where more TAs are available.

### Instructor Office Hours
Professors Hott and Horton will be holding drop-in office hours on Zoom.  Currently, we are planning to be available during our normal lecture times on Mondays and Wednesdays.  We will also occasionally drop in on Discord.  As always, we are also available to schedule meetings if our normal office hour times do not work for you--we understand that every situation is unique at this point.

### Regrades
Coming soon!
