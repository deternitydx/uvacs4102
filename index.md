# CS4102 Algorithms - Spring 2020

**Course Description:** Introduces the analysis of algorithms and the
effects of data structures on them. Algorithms selected from areas such
as sorting, searching, shortest paths, greedy algorithms, backtracking,
divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. Data structures include
heaps and search, splay, and spanning trees. Analysis techniques include
asymptotic worst-case, expected time, amortized analysis, and reductions
between problems

**Availability:** It is important to us to be available to our students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with either of us during our office hours, e-mail us and we will find the time to meet. That being said, like everybody else we are quite busy, so it may take a day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the course---what is working, what is not working, what can be done better, etc.---we are very interested in hearing about them.  Please send Prof. Hott, Prof. Wu, or one of the TAs an e-mail or post privately on Piazza to the instructors. We tend to get bogged down by e-mail as the semester progresses, so seeing us in person (right after lecture, during office hours, etc.) is often a good way to get a more immediate response.

**Syllabus:** Coming Soon
