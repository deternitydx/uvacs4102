## Collaboration Resources

We want to continue to encourage collaboration on the homeworks, even if we are not physically together anymore.  To aid in that, we'd like to share a list of software and tools that will help make collaboration go as smoothly as possible.  Here is a current list, but please send us your suggestions and we'll add them here.  We discourage the use of Overleaf to share documents, since it may lead to copy/paste and violation of our honor policy.
